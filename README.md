N-BEATS Forecast Visualization

This project demonstrates a dashboard using data from a trained N-BEATS model for time series forecasting, which I exported  into a .json format, and visualized interactively on a very simple web app built with React, Recharts, and Three.js.

-> Features
Trains an N-BEATS model on a time series dataset.
Saves forecasts and metrics in a structured .json file.
React frontend for visualization:
📊 Recharts → 2D line/bar charts of forecasts vs actuals.
🌐 Three.js → 3D visualization of trends and patterns.
